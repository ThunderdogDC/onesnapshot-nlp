# OneSnapshot NLP

NLP experimentation framework for mapping evidence library records to DBT workstreams.

The project supports multiple approaches to workstream classification, including:

- Hardcoded directorate and ALB mappings
- Sentence-transformer bi-encoders
- Cross-encoder rerankers
- Natural Language Inference (NLI) models
- AWS Bedrock LLMs

Experiments are configuration-driven and can be reproduced from saved experiment metadata.


## Public Repository Version

This repository contains synthetic example configuration files.

The original project used organisation-specific workstreams,
departments and mappings which have been replaced with fictional
examples while preserving the structure and behaviour of the system.

This allows the architecture and implementation to be shared
without exposing internal business information.

---

## Current Limitations

This public repository version is not currently fully executable outside of the original organisational environment.

The original project depends on a small number of organisation-specific Python packages, including internal utilities used for functionality such as AWS integration and experiment workflows. These dependencies are not publicly available and have therefore not been included in this repository.

The core NLP experimentation framework, model evaluation approaches, configuration structure, and documentation are available for review. Work is ongoing to remove or replace internal dependencies with publicly available alternatives so that the full pipeline can be reproduced in a standalone environment.

Until those changes are complete:

- the repository can be inspected and extended,
- the architecture and modelling approaches can be reviewed,
- some components may run after installing available public dependencies,
- full end-to-end execution requires access to the original organisational packages.

---

## Project Goal

Given an evidence library record and a set of DBT workstreams, the pipeline generates ranked workstream predictions and evaluates them against manually labelled mappings.

The framework is designed for:

- experimentation and model comparison
- reproducibility
- evaluation of retrieval and ranking approaches
- robust handling of LLM outputs

---

## Project Status

This project is actively maintained and continues to be used for NLP experimentation and evaluation.

While the core experimentation framework, evaluation pipeline and LLM validation workflows are well established, development is ongoing to further improve production-readiness. Current areas of focus include expanding automated test coverage, increasing robustness through additional validation and error handling, and introducing more comprehensive integration testing.

These improvements are intended to complement the existing experimentation framework while maintaining reproducibility and ease of extension.

## Installation

The original project used an organisation-specific setup script to recreate its development environment. This script relied on internal package sources and cached environments that are not available in this public repository.

A standalone public installation workflow is currently being prepared.

The current environment definition can be inspected in `pyproject.toml`, but full installation requires access to the original organisational dependencies.

---

## Running an Experiment

```bash
python -m src.main
```

runs an experiment using the default `experiment_config.yaml`, `new_mapping.yaml`, and `workstreams.yaml` configuration files.


Optionally specify alternative mapping and workstream files:

```bash
python -m src.main \
    -c configs/{some_experiment_config.yaml} \
    -m configs/{some_mapping.yaml} \
    -w configs/{some_workstreams.yaml}
```

---

## Running Tests
Run tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

which should also produce a coverage report due to the default settings in the `pyproject.toml` file.

---

## Documentation

Additional documentation is available in:

| Document | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|
| architecture.md | Pipeline design, modelling approaches and design rationale |
